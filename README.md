# Evaluation Metric for GAN's
The evaluation of supervised image classification is simple. The projected output must be compared to the actual production. To get this fake(generated) image, though, you use a GAN and some random noise. This created image should appear as authentic as possible. So, how do you measure the reality of this computer-generated image? Or, to put it another way, how can you assess GAN?

## Frechet Inception Distance(FID) Score
One of the most widely used measures for determining the feature distance between real and produced images is **Frechet Inception Distance (FID)**. Frechet Distance is a measure of similarity between curves that takes the placement and ordering of points along the curves into account. It can also be used to calculate the difference between two distributions.

Where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the normal distributions, X, and Y are two normal distributions.

**Inception V3** model is employ, which has been pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset, for GAN evaluation. The score is called "Frechet Inception Distance" because it uses activations from the Inception V3 model to summarise each image.

The Frechet Inception Distance for "multivariate", normal distribution, that is GAN, is given by

where X and Y are the real and fake embeddings. μX  and μY are the magnitudes of the vector X and Y. Tr is the trace of the matrix.

## GAN Model
I have build a DCGAN model to generate fake anime characters. The Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) optimizer is employed with the Generator and Discriminator models. Note that the trained model is only intended to demonstrate FID score and may not be the best model available.

### FID Score
The computed FID score is:  474.022

## Scope for improvement
Now that we know how to calculate FID Score, we can employ this into the network checkpoint. The FID score lowers as the model checkpoint improves. A model checkpoint with a low FID score for inference can be chosen as best model the generates images near to original images. In other words, the distribution of images generated by the best model is as close to the distribution of the original image.
